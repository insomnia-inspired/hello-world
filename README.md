# hello-world
Let's hope this doesn't turn into a miserable failure, yeah?

I've worked with some types of code before, but I've never really done anything project-wise with it.
Since I already know there's no way I'll be in a robotics/computer science program in college, I figure this way I can at least make a hobby out of it.
